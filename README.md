An videogame enterprise wants to make a simulation about an old videogame genre. We decided to make a simulation through console using mobs from minecraft (the videogame). 

This practise meets the interface segregation principle because you use an static class called Mob and it segregates to the different Mobs. It also uses two interfaces that inicializates a method receiveAttack and Attack that you can use in the main class called App.
